## PMI FE decomposing use case

**Synopsis**: PMI has engaged into a digital transformation process which aims to transform
both the organizational landscape and the technology landscape, aiming to transition
towards a Product Based Organization.

Under the current setup, the company is running a platform that enables the entire digital
portfolio and our intent is to decompose the platform in more specific and targeted
products.

As a starting point, we have decided to decompose out Face to Face technologies first into
different product areas, as follows:

- Field Force Application
- Direct Retail Application
- Indirect Retail Application
- Direct Retail POS Application

These applications offer the same functionality including, but not limited to:

- Consumer Registration
- Interaction gathering
- Sales on spot
- Stock tracking
- Data + Privacy

The reason for decomposition is to give more freedom to each of these streams so that they
can shape their own application experience and tailor fit these applications to market /
regions needs. Because of this, it is important not to have dependencies between these
applications that will slow down changes in the future.

The expectations for this decomposition efforts are as follows:

- We want to achieve a consistent look and feel across these applications, despite
  multiple teams working on them.
- We want to be cost efficient with the engineering process and reuse as much as
  possible between the teams, without creating dependencies.
- We want any of the product groups to be able to deploy their applications in isolation
- We want the teams to be accountable end to end for a piece of functionality,
  backend to front-end
- We want the teams to operate under a “you build it, you run it mantra”
  The ask: Focusing first and foremost on the front-end aspects, deliver a strategy that would
  lead to us achieving our decomposition efforts of Face-to-Face solutions, in a format of your
  choosing (Presentation, documentation, proof of concept, etc).
  Considerations:

- The strategy should focus mostly on the front-end engineering aspects
- The strategy should be able to be implemented in an agile, iterative approach
- The current applications have to continue to be operational throughout the
  transformation process and not impact customer experience or revenue
- The strategy should cover organization, processes and technology as a minimum
